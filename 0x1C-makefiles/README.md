# 0x1B. C - Makefiles
## About
An introductory project on:
- Makefiles and how to use them
- Explicit and implicit rules
- Setting variables
## Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04
- gcc 4.8.4
- GNU Make 3.81
- Source files for all Makefiles: [main.c](main.c), [holberton.c](holberton.c), [m.h](m.h)

  * Requirements:
    * name of the executable: `holberton`
    * rules: `all`
      * `all`: builds your executable
    * variables: `CC`, `SRC`

      * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      * `oclean`: deletes the object files
      * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
    * variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`
      * `CC`: the compiler to be used
      * `SRC`: the `.c` files
      * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
      * `NAME`: the name of the executable
      * `RM`: the command to delete files
    * The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
    * You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

**[4-Makefile](4-Makefile)**
  * Requirements:
    * name of the executable: `holberton`
    * rules: `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`
      * `all`: builds your executable
      * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      * `oclean`: deletes the object files
      * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
    * variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`, `CFLAGS`
      * `CC`: the compiler to be used
      * `SRC`: the `.c` files
      * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
      * `NAME`: the name of the executable
      * `RM`: the command to delete files
      * `CFLAGS`: compiler flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
    * The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
    * You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files
    * The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re` rules should never fail
    
### Advanced
**[100-Makefile](100-Makefile)**
  * Requirements:
    * name of the executable: `holberton`
    * rules: `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`
      * `all`: builds your executable
      * `clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
      * `oclean`: deletes the object files
      * `fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
      * `re`: forces recompilation of all source files
    * variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`, `CFLAGS`
      * `CC`: the compiler to be used
      * `SRC`: the `.c` files
      * `OBJ`: the `.o` files
      * `NAME`: the name of the executable
      * `RM`: the command to delete files
      * `CFLAGS`: compiler flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
    * The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
    * You are not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files
    * The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re` rules should never fail
    * You have to use `$(RM)` for the cleaning up rules, but you are not allowed to set the `RM` variable
    * You are only allowed to use the string `$(CC)` once in your Makefile
    * You are only allowed to use the string `$(RM)` twice in your Makefile
    * You are not allowed to use the string `$(CFLAGS)` (but the compiler should still use the flags you set in this variable)
    * You are not allowed to have an `$(OBJ)` rule
    * You are not allowed to use the `%.o: %.c` rule
    * Your Makefile should work even if there is a file in the folder that has the same name as one of your rules
    * Your Makefile should not compile if the header file `m.h` is missing
