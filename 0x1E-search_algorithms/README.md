# Search Algorithms

## Overview
A search algorithm retrieves information stored within some data structure. Search algorithms can be classified based on the search criteria. They are also evaluated based on their complexity or maximum theoretical run time.

Linear search is also known as sequential search. It is a method used for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Its complexity is O(n) and best-case performance is O(1).

Binary search goes by several different names. It is also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. Binary search algorithm has a maximum complexity of O(log n), or logarithmic time.
